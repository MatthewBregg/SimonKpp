SimonK Rewritten in C++

This project does not currently work.  It spin a motor, with severe heating issues, and desynchs.

It will after a handful of seconds wind up with !power_on && goodies == 0, and then exit the run loop. 
Here's a video of that.

Still, it's something.

I've unsure if the issue is simply a resource issue from moving to C++, or a logic error in the code. 

Maybe one day in the future I'll come back to this and find out.
